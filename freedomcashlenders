Pew research has found that payday loans, and similar products such as auto title loans, hurt millions of borrowers annually. A typical payday loan is for $375 and is due in full in just two weeks. With fees, this lump-sum payment consumes 36 percent of a typical borrowerâ€™s pretax paycheck, which is just too much for most people to handle. In fact, most payday loans are taken out to cover shortfalls created by paying back a previous payday loan. The average borrower ends up in debt for nearly half the year and pays more than $520 in fees for that $375 loan.
